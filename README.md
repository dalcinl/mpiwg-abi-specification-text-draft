#  MPI-5 ABI Specific Text Draft Repository

A draft of the ABI specification text in Markdown.

The MPI specification is written in LaTeX, with lots of special macros.  It's also not public.

This project is to write a draft of the specification text in Markdown in public.
This will allow us to write quickly and collaborate easily, including with
interested parties who do not have access to the private LaTeX repository.
